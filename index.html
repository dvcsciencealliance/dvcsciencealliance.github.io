    <p>
      The Science Alliance is a collection of clubs at DVC that have a shared interest in the science fields. Our clubs share a common desire for a deeper understanding of the world around us, a principle at the heart of science.  We unite around this common desire to create a way for us to expand on and apply this knowledge. We seek to develop better opportunities for our student body and generations of students their after to achieve their utmost potential, enhancing not only themselves but humanityâ€™s future as well.
