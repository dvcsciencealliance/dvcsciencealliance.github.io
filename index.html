      About Us
    </h1>
    <h4>
      The Science Alliance is a collection of clubs at DVC that have a shared interest in science. Our clubs share a common desire for a deeper understanding of the world around us, a principle at the heart of science.  We unite around this common desire to create a way for us to expand on and apply this knowledge. We seek to develop better opportunities for our student body and generations of students thereafter to achieve their utmost potential, enhancing not only themselves but humanityâ€™s future as well.

        Vertical Farming Project
      </h1>
      <h4>
        <p>
          Aquaponics and vertical farming current best practices will be thoroughly studied and researched to design, engineer and develop working models that will be used to raise consumable fish, which provide fertilizer through their excretions that will be used to raise edible plants in an integrated system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Available local materials and accessible resources will be used to design and build scientifically supported, practical, relatively low cost proof-of-concept prototypes.
